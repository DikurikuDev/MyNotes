# Mobile Components

Components and configuration that are important to test in the mobile.

## StatusBar

"Component to control the app's status bar. The status bar is the zone, typically at the top of the screen, that displays the current time, Wi-Fi and cellular network information, battery level and/or other status icons."

```ts
// when the background color is hidding the status bar icons
<StatusBar barStyle="light-content" /> //or dark-content
```

## SafeAreaView

"The purpose of SafeAreaView is to render content within the safe area boundaries of a device. It is currently only applicable to iOS devices with iOS version 11 or later."
